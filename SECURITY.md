## Responsible Disclosure Security Policy

A responsible disclosure policy helps protect users of the project from publicly disclosed security vulnerabilities without a fix by employing a process where vulnerabilities are first triaged in a private manner, and only publicly disclosed after a reasonable time period that allows patching the vulnerability and provides an upgrade path for users.

When contacting us directly via email, we will do our best efforts to respond in a reasonable time to resolve the issue. When contacting a security program their disclosure policy will provide details on time-frame, processes and paid bounties.

We kindly ask you to refrain from malicious acts that put our users, the project, or any of the project's team members at risk.

## Reporting a Security Issue

We consider the security of our systems a top priority. But no matter how much effort we put into system security, there can still be vulnerabilities present.

If you discover a security vulnerability, please use one of the following means of communications to report it to us:

- Report the security issue to the Node.js Security Working Group through the [HackerOne program](https://hackerone.com/nodejs-ecosystem) for ecosystem modules on npm, or to [Snyk Security Team](https://snyk.io/vulnerability-disclosure). They will help triage the security issue and work with all involved parties to remediate and release a fix.

- Report the security issue to the MetaMask team directly at [metamask.security@consensys.net](mailto:metamask.security@consensys.net).

Your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings are sincerely appreciated and will be taken into account to acknowledge your contributions.
